## My process

started off this project with css flex. This NAV is a Flexbox, banner also is a 
flex box then the article section was developed with grids. This website is responsive as well.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- With very little Bootstrap




### Continued development

I'll keep on working on my Javascript skills as well as my media query skills and also using responsive grids to reduce the need of media queries.
